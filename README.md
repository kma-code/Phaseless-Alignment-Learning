# Code repository for experiments with Phaseless Alignment Learning

This repo contains experiments and links to other simulations implementing PAL.
Paper "Learning efficient backprojections across cortical hierarchies in real time" available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10249

Three separate setups were used for experiments:

1) Figures 3 and 4a,b: Dendritic microcircuit simulator. [THIS REPO](https://github.com/kma-code/Pseudo-backprop-Lab/tree/master/PAL\ MC)
2) Figures 4c,d,e,f: Dendritic microcircuit simulator based on GeNN. LINK TO REPO (available shortly)
3) Figure 5: Based on Generalized Latent Equilibrium codebase. LINK TO REPO (available shortly)

In order to run an specific setup, please go to the corresponding repo.
